User Request: {{ prompt }}

You MUST format your response exactly as follows:

```code
# Your Manim code goes here
```
```exp
# Your explanation of the code goes here
```

Do not deviate from this format. The code block must contain only the Manim code, and the exp block must contain your explanation.
