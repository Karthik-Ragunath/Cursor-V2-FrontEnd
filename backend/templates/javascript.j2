Instructions:

- Follow functional programming principles where suitable

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Consider performance implications
- Follow clean code principles
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Include type hints in comments if relevant

User Request: {{ prompt }}

You MUST format your response exactly as follows:

```code
// Your JavaScript code goes here
```
```exp
// Your explanation of the code goes here
```

Do not deviate from this format. The code block must contain only the JavaScript code, and the exp block must contain your explanation.
